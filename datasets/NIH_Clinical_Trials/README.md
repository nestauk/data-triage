=========================
This data triaging is to examine the suitability of [NIH Clinical Trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home) database for the study of COVID-19.

The database currently contains ~350K studies with ~3.5K of them being on COVID-19. It covers studies conducted across the world and according to their website, they started recording them from 2000 (submitting the data to the platform became compulsory in 2009).

Basic information that all studies must include:
- Participant Flow. A tabular summary of the progress of participants through each stage of a study, by study arm or comparison group. It includes the numbers of participants who started, completed, and dropped out of each period of the study based on the sequence in which interventions were assigned.
- Baseline Characteristics. A tabular summary of the data collected at the beginning of a study for all participants, by study arm or comparison group. These data include demographics, such as age and gender, and study-specific measures (for example, systolic blood pressure, prior antidepressant treatment).
- Outcome Measures and Statistical Analyses. A tabular summary of Outcome measure values, by study arm or comparison group. It includes tables for each prespecified Primary Outcome and Secondary Outcome and may also include other prespecified outcomes, post hoc outcomes, and any appropriate statistical analyses.
- Adverse Events. A tabular summary of all anticipated and unanticipated Serious adverse event and a tabular summary of anticipated and unanticipated other adverse events exceeding a specific frequency threshold. For each serious or other adverse event, the summary includes the adverse event term, affected organ system, number of participants at risk, and number of participants affected, by study arm or comparison group.

Overall, I estimate it would take a week to collect the data (this could be batched if necessary) and the cost for hosting it would be negligible.
