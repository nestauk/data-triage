Data source: github-eu-covid
============================

This is to study the contributions to GitHub in the context of the covid-19 pandemic, specifically within the EU.

At time of writing, there were nearly 12,000 repositories tagged with one 231 covid-related topics on GitHub. Of these, 20 topics explicitly mention EU countries. The geographic distribution of the repositories is, of course, blurred by the contribution of global or general packages.

Core entities within the dataset are: repositories, organisations, contributors and topics. From inspection, repositories are broadly:

* Data journalism
* Epidemiological modelling
* Epidemiological measurement
* New technologies with applications to covid (e.g. tracing apps)

The dataset would cost around \$40 to collect, with potentially up to an additional \$400 to collect a counterfactual sample of data. The data collection time would be between 2 hours and 1 day, and data storage costs would be neglible.

Temporal coverage is good, from March 2020 onwards (noting that the number of new repos relating to covid has plateaued since that time).

Unless extensions are required (e.g. in-depth analysis of the codebase), then development will likely take one week. There are uncertainties, since the collection will be batched it could be temperamental. The number of required collections could be significantly higher, but it is difficult to calculate this properly in advance.
