Data Triage
===========

A lightweight framework for triaging new open data sources.

Setup a new triage by doing (from your favourite UNIX shell):

    bash start-triage.sh <DATASET NAME>


What's the point?
-----------------

Introducing disparate open data sources into a single framework is a messy process,
since a-priori you simply don't know the:

1. Practicalities of the collection (collection time, cost, disk-space, codebase development time)
2. Coverage of the data (geographic, temporal, ecosystem)
3. Shape of the data (what "tables" and "columns" can you expect to get from the data?)


I want to triage a new dataset!
-------------------------------
Great! Take a fork and send us over a tidy PR and we'd be happy to include your triage in our codebase.
